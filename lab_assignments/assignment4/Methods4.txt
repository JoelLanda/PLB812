Methods:
First an index was built using the genome annotation gff file and the fasta file of the entire reference genome. To do this 
the exons and splice sites were retrieved from the gff file using the commands hisat2_extract_splice_sites.py and hisat2_extract_exons.py.
The index was then created using the hisat2-build command with arguments -p 8 to increase the number of processing cores used, 
--ss to specify splice sites and --exon to specify the exons file. The Hisat2 command was then used to align the RNA-seq data
to the reference genome index that was created. This was run with -p 10 argument and also piped into the samtools view and samtools sort 
commands. samtools view converts the output files into a bam format with the argument -bh. samtools sort sorts the alignments that 
are created. the -@ argument for samtools specifies how many threads to run the program on.
