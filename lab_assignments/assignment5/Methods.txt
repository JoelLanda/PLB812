Methods:
Read counts were generated using the HTSeq-count command specifying the -f bam argument to tell htseq that the inputs are bam files.
The union mode was used by default to generate htseq count txt files. The htseq output for each sample was then used to do a DEG expression analysis
in R using DESeq2. list.files was used to create the sampleFiles object. data.frame was used to create the sampleTable object as a data frame with 
colums called sampleName, fileName, and treatment. The sub command was used to remove the ".txt" and "-1.txt" from the file name to create the 
sampleName and treatment columns. The factor command was then used to convert the treatment vector to a factor. The DESeq object was then created using 
the DESeqDataSetFromHTSeqCount function. rguments of this function specify the sampleTable, directory with files and design (treatment). 
The control treatment was then set as the reference using the relevel command. data was normalized using the estimatesizefactors command 
dispersions were estimated with the estimatedispersions command. The DESeq command was then run on the DESeq object (dds) with the argument test="LRT"
to specify a log ratio test. A wald test was then performed on dds using the nbinomwaldtest command. an object called resultsTable was then created  
with the as.data.frame command. The nrow and na.omit functions were used to call the number of rows omitting any rows with a p value greater than 0.05.
results were plotted using the plotMA command with the ylim argument at (-2,2) to only show Y-axis values that are between 2 and -2 fold change.
