fastq files for my samples were in my scratch directory from the initial download of the SRR accessions. I used trimmomatic 
to trim adapter sequences and low quality reads. I also used fastqc to check the quality of the trimmed data. These programs 
were run in a bash script and submitted to SLURM. The bash script contained a cd to the scratch directory with my files, a
line adding the conda environment to PATH, a line adding the LD_library to PATH, and a for loop running the trimmomatic PE 
command and the fastqc command. The trimmomatic comand specified paired end reads, 10 threads, phred33, truseq3 adapter sequences, 
2 seed mismatches allowed, palindrome clip cutoff of 30, simple clip threshhold of 10, and minimum length of reads 30. 10 threads 
were used to speed up the process, phred33 specifies how phred scores are interpreted. minimum length of 30 was used to filter out
reads that may be adapter reads or other small sequences that are not useful.
