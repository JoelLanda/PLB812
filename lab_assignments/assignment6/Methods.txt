Methods:

GO terms were downloaded from phytozome. columns 2 and 10 were isolated using the cut 
command specifying -f2,10. A list of only unique genes was created from these columns using
the sort and uniq commands. Next a while loop was used to format the rest of the file and 
concatenate with the unique gene list that was generated in the previous step. DESeq2 outputs
were formatted on R using  the as.integer function to label each gene in the list as 
either 0 or 1. genes labeled 1 have a padj value of less than 0.05 and are greater than 
equal to 1 or less than equal to -1. the factor function was then used to convert vectors 
into a factor. This was for both upregulated genes (log2FC >= 1) and downregulated (log2FC <= -1)
separately. Using the new() function in topGO, the topGO objects for each list of DEGs was 
created. Three topGO ojects were made (BP, MF, and CC) for each of the two DEG lists. The runTest 
function was used on each topGO object and for each gene ontology category (MF, BP, CC). Arguments 
specified to use the parentchild algorithm and fisher statistical test. The GenTable function was then used 
with arguments that pointed to the fisher test outputs.
