Methods:


The genome assembly and annotation files were downloaded from Phytozome. The Phytozome search bar was used to find the
most updated version of the Solanum Tuberosum genome. The command line download was selected and the code was copy and 
pasted onto the hpcc and run. To download RNA-seq data SRAtools was installed using the wget command, unzipped using the
tar command and moved to the plb812 environment. fasterq-dumb command was then used to retrieve paired fastq files with the 
accession numbers: SRR5448182 SRR5448183 SRR5448184 SRR5448185 SRR5448186 SRR5448187
