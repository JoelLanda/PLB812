Methods:
A new environment called ortho was created and orthofinder was installed using conda.
Files were downloaded using the command line download from phytozome. Files were then unzipped using the gunzip command and 
renamed to Athaliana.fa, Atrichopoda.fa, and Osativa.fa. files were then placed in a directory called ortho and orthofinder 
was run through a SLURM submission with the command orthofinder -f ortho specifying the directory with the files. 
lines in the N0.tsv file were counted using the command wc -l to count the number of orthogroups identified. grep was then used
to determine the number of orthogroups in rice that belong to the HAESA orthogroup in Arabidopsis.
