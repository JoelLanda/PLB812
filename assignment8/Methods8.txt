First picard was used to mark the duplicates in the bam alignment file. the input was the bam alignment file and 
I specified names for the output and metrics file. Gatk was then used to add theread groups. this was achieved with the 
AddOrReplaceReadGroups command in gatk the input file and output file were specified along with the read group library
and read group ID. The read group platform was set as ILLUMINA. the read group sample name was set to WS2. After adding 
read groups variants were called using the gatk command HaplotypeCaller. In this command the input file with read 
groups and the reference genome were ued as inputs and the output filename was specified.
